# Fitness APP

When I started working out I used to write down my workouts into a notebook. This was, however, not very practical as I always had to list through many pages before finfing the workout I wanted to do. So, i thought, why not make an APP for that!

## Project outline
* Organize and display workout plans
* Server as a workout diary
* Set dates when Ill go to the gym
